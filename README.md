## Example React.js Project

-> Following [this tutorial](https://github.com/dcneiner/netmag-react-tutorial)

## Usage

To follow along with the article, clone this repository (see below for running) and work from the `master` branch.

If you want to see the finished version, checkout the `finished` branch:

```bash
git checkout finished
```

## Running

The only prerequisite is that [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is installed.

Clone this repository to a folder on your computer, then within the new folder, run the following:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the dependencies, compile the built JavaScript, and then start a server for you to view the running example at <http://localhost:8080>. Any changes you make to the existing `jsx` files will trigger `webpack` to automatically rebuild. Refresh your browser to see your changes, no need to restart `npm start`.

## React Tools

I'd recommend running the example in Chrome and using the [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) to interact with it.
